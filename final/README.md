## Hands-on session material of your own

- You will create yet another MED263 hands-on session material plus homework-style questions and answers using software tools and data different from the ones used in the class.
- TA should be able to download the data following the instruction in your report.
- TA should be able to follow the instruction and code in your report to reproduce your results, also in the report.
- TA should be able to reproduce the answers to the questions provided in your report.
- You can re-organize one of the how-to-style journal articles in MED263 final project [sign-up sheet](http://bit.ly/2017med263final) or replicate one of MED263 course with different data and software tools.
- You will submit a technical report in pdf format.
- The final project report will have sections of Introduction, Data, Methods/Results, and References. (Unlike typical journal, you will combine Methods and Results into one section.)
- Methods/Results section will have instruction, code, results (numbers/tables/figure), homework-style questions, and homework-style answers.
- There is no page limit.
- The example final project report (.pdf) can be found at [MED263 class GitHub](https://github.com/jihoonkim/MED263/blob/master/final/MED263_final_project_example.pdf).
